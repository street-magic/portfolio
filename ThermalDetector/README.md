# Thermal Sensor People Detection
An efficient, low-cost solution for monitoring if a bed-ridden patient is attended by a healthcare professional would hugely benefit the healthcare system. \
The software determines whether a hospital bed is empty, occupied or occupied along with another person present next to the bed. Such software could be used for a number of applications, one of them is to monitor whether or not a healthcare professional has sanitized their hands before approaching patientâ€™s bed. \
